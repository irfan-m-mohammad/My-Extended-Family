## Description
People are related to one another in a way they can't imagine. If the relationship between people is represented pictorially, one feels overwhelmed seeing the way someone is related to him/her. The application should help the user to know who he/she is related to! This application should be able to reconnect the families that have been dormant for years. 

## Features
The idea of the project is to develop an application with the following features  
- A relationship chart that shows the connections between people showing how they are related.
- A map interface that shows the location of their dear ones so that they can see who's nearby and plan a hangout. 
- A Newsfeed sort of tool for posting updates of events like marriages, parties etc.
