#Tailor Search & Booking Service
## Objective
Our intent is to provide to a tool to locate, book tailoring service and have a database of individuals measurement. 

## Problem Statement
Most of the time we are faced with issues where we are unable to catch hold of our tailors because he is already overloaded depending on the season. If we would like to change the tailor we always have to physically give new measurements because sample clothes do not always fit anymore. We would like to solve those problems with our tool.

## Major Highlights

- To create a database of the tailors in the city.
- Provide user with information about tailors availability, expected delivery for particular clothing, price range, skills etc.
- Have user select the various options for particular clothing before placing an order for measurements.
- Have a database of measurements for particular clothing type, which negates the hassle of taking measurement again if user decides to go with another tailor.
